\section{Introduction}
This document presents detailed test instructions of the  TimeMate system.

\section{Reference Documents}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Software Verification and Validation Specification: 	TimeMate, v. 1.0, Doc. number: PUSS214202
\end{enumerate}

\section{Test Instructions}
The detailed test instructions for the test cases introduced in ref. 1 are shown in appendices below. Test cases are a set of instructions that are carried out by the tester in numerical order. Before a function test is carried out, the preconditions described in the “Start state” should be met. When steps are initiated with “Check that” they describe an expected result of the system, and the testers' task' is to make sure that the expected result is given.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{System Test:} All system tests are done in a review manner. 
\item \textbf{Function Test:} Function test FT1 and FT2 are executable tests. FT3-FT31 are done in a review manner. 
\item \textbf{Regression Test:} All regression tests are done in a review manner.
